# HCPS – Historical Combat Performance Simulator

A GPT-powered ensemble model and Monte Carlo simulation built to rank 130+ warriors from the Three Kingdoms and post-Han era based on 1v1 combat effectiveness.

This project blends historical analysis, AI modeling, and statistical methods to produce a composite warrior ranking with percentile normalization and integrity controls.

## 🔍 Core Features
- 🛡️ Trait-based scoring system across 12 combat categories (e.g., Offense, Agility, Fight IQ)
- 🧠 GPT-audited rating system using randomized logic-gated prompts
- 🎲 Monte Carlo simulation layer with 30 trial iterations
- 📊 Percentile-normalized score aggregation (peak, top-10 frequency, volatility)
- ✅ Integrity-adjusted rankings with feedback loop auditing

## 📂 File Overview
